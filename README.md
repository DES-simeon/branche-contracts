## branche reward token crowdsale
proportional refund ICO: Forked [Dennis Peterson's proportional refund](http://www.blunderingcode.com/fairtokensales/). This has its own repository at [DES-simeon/Fairsale](https://github.com/DES-simeon/Fairsale).

Token sales have a particular set of new problems of fairness not seen on other crowdfunding platforms. We are attempting to avoid the overspending problems seen with uncapped ICOs, while still ensuring nobody gets locked out from contributing.

Simply put, we let people contribute as much as they like, then give refunds in proportion to how much we exceed our max goal. E.g. if your cap is $1 million and you collect $2 million, then everybody gets half their contribution back. If you collect $3 million then everyone gets 2/3 back, and so on. This will ensure that everyone gets a slice of the pie as it were, no matter how greedy any one party tried to be or how late in the ICO they contributed.

## branche reward token issuance
